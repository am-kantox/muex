# Muex

Mutation testing library for Elixir, Erlang, and other languages.

Muex evaluates test suite quality by introducing deliberate bugs (mutations) into code and verifying that tests catch them. It provides a language-agnostic architecture with dependency injection, making it easy to extend support to new languages.

## Features

- Language-agnostic architecture with pluggable language adapters
- Built-in support for Elixir and Erlang
- Intelligent file filtering to focus on business logic:
  - Analyzes code complexity and characteristics
  - Automatically excludes framework code (behaviours, protocols, supervisors)
  - Skips low-complexity files (Mix tasks, reporters, configurations)
  - Prioritizes files with testable logic (conditionals, arithmetic, pattern matching)
- 6 mutation strategies:
  - Arithmetic operators (+/-, *//)
  - Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
  - Boolean logic (and/or, &&/||, true/false, not)
  - Literal values (numbers, strings, lists, atoms)
  - Function calls (remove calls, swap arguments)
  - Conditionals (if/unless mutations)
- Parallel mutation execution with configurable concurrency
- Sophisticated mutation optimization heuristics (50-70% reduction)
- Colored terminal output with mutation scores and detailed reports
- Integration with ExUnit
- Hot module swapping for efficient testing

## Installation

Add `muex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:muex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

Run mutation testing on your project:

```bash
mix muex
```

By default, Muex intelligently filters files to focus on business logic and skip framework code. This dramatically reduces the number of mutations tested.

### File Filtering Options

```bash
# Use intelligent filtering (default)
mix muex

# Show which files are included/excluded
mix muex --verbose

# Adjust minimum complexity score (default: 20)
mix muex --min-score 30

# Disable filtering to test all files
mix muex --no-filter

# Limit total mutations tested
mix muex --max-mutations 500
```

### File Selection

```bash
# Run on specific directory
mix muex --files "lib/myapp"

# Run on specific file
mix muex --files "lib/my_module.ex"

# Run on files matching glob pattern (single level)
mix muex --files "lib/muex/*.ex"

# Run on files matching recursive glob pattern
mix muex --files "lib/**/compiler*.ex"
mix muex --files "lib/{muex,mix}/**/*.ex"
```

### Other Options

```bash
# Use specific mutators
mix muex --mutators arithmetic,comparison,boolean

# Set concurrency and timeout
mix muex --concurrency 4 --timeout 10000

# Fail if mutation score below threshold
mix muex --fail-at 80

# Enable mutation optimization (balanced preset)
mix muex --optimize

# Use conservative optimization (best balance)
mix muex --optimize --optimize-level conservative

# Use aggressive optimization (fastest)
mix muex --optimize --optimize-level aggressive

# Custom optimization settings
mix muex --optimize --min-complexity 3 --max-per-function 15
```

## Mutation Optimization

Muex includes sophisticated heuristics to reduce the number of mutants tested while maintaining mutation testing effectiveness. This can reduce testing time by 50-70% with minimal impact on mutation score.

### When to Use Optimization

- **CI/CD pipelines**: Use conservative mode for fast feedback with <1% score impact
- **Development iteration**: Use balanced mode for rapid checks
- **Pre-release validation**: Disable optimization for complete coverage

### Optimization Levels

**Conservative** (recommended for CI/CD):
- 50-65% reduction in mutations
- <1% impact on mutation score
- Focuses on high-complexity code
- Preserves boundary condition mutations

```bash
mix muex --optimize --optimize-level conservative
```

**Balanced** (default, good for development):
- 70-85% reduction in mutations
- 5-10% impact on mutation score
- Fast feedback during development
- Focuses on highest-impact mutations

```bash
mix muex --optimize
```

**Aggressive** (rapid checks only):
- 85-95% reduction in mutations
- 10-15% impact on mutation score
- Very fast but may miss edge cases

```bash
mix muex --optimize --optimize-level aggressive
```

### How It Works

The optimizer uses 7 strategies:

1. **Equivalent Mutant Detection**: Filters semantically equivalent mutations
2. **Code Complexity Scoring**: Skips mutations in trivial code (getters, simple guards)
3. **Impact Scoring**: Prioritizes mutations by risk level (1-11 points)
4. **Mutation Clustering**: Groups similar mutations and samples representatives
5. **Per-Function Limits**: Caps mutations per function to prevent explosion
6. **Boundary Prioritization**: Always preserves critical comparison mutations
7. **Pattern-Based Filtering**: Removes known low-value mutations

For detailed information, see [docs/MUTATION_OPTIMIZATION.md](docs/MUTATION_OPTIMIZATION.md).

### Example: Cart Project

Real-world results from the shopping cart example (440 LOC, 84 tests):

| Mode | Mutations | Time | Score | Best For |
|------|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| Baseline | 886 | ~3 min | 99.77% | Final validation |
| Conservative | 308 | ~1 min | 99.35% | CI/CD |
| Balanced | 28 | ~10 sec | 89.29% | Development |

See [examples/cart/OPTIMIZATION_RESULTS.md](examples/cart/OPTIMIZATION_RESULTS.md) for complete analysis.

## Available Mutators

Muex provides 6 comprehensive mutation strategies:

- **Arithmetic**: Mutates `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operators (swap, remove, identity)
- **Comparison**: Mutates `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, `!==` operators
- **Boolean**: Mutates `and`, `or`, `&&`, `||`, `true`, `false`, `not` (swap, negate, remove)
- **Literal**: Mutates numbers (±1), strings (empty/append), lists (empty), atoms (change)
- **FunctionCall**: Removes function calls and swaps first two arguments
- **Conditional**: Inverts conditions, removes branches, converts `unless` to `if`

## Supported Languages

- **Elixir**: Full support with ExUnit integration
- **Erlang**: Full support with native BEAM integration

Both languages benefit from hot module swapping for efficient mutation testing.
